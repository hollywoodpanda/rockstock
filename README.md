# rockstock
To stock it is to rock it

## howto

Open the project in _IntelliJ IDEA_, build it and press play. Open the **RockStock.postman_collection.json** in _Postman_ and play with the two operations in this API.

Remember to point to an existing file on the `canonical_path` collection variable (you can just change the string and ignore the variable):

```json
{
    "canonicalPath": "{{canonical_path}}"
}
```
